To solve this, Featurist developed a new course editing platform that used Git as a content store, allowing us to publish one version while working on and previewing another. We could import content from their legacy learning portal that had been curated for historical courses. Content editors could then view and edit content, preview or publish it for students. We used CouchDB to help replicate content from the web site to iPad clients. The UI for the editor was built using Plastiq (now known as hyperdom). The server was built using Node JS and we leaned heavily on node-libgit and PouchDB. For deployment into their on-premises data centre we used linux nodes running docker and scripts using the docker API to automate the deployment."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"testing-approach"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#testing-approach","ariaLabel":"testing approach permalink","className":["anchor"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"svg","properties":{"ariaHidden":"true","focusable":"false","height":"16","version":"1.1","viewBox":"0 0 16 16","width":"16"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"path","properties":{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"},"children":[]}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Testing Approach"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"During the course of the development Featurist developed cutting edge methods of testing single page applications.

For this reason we developed technology that\nemulated user behaviour and asserted that the UI and API responded accordingly, regardless of framework.

We did this by building Sworm, which allowed us to specify the models as maintainable object graphs in Node JS, and then save them to the database with their relationships intact. Sworm has continued to help\nus with our clients since then and has adapters for Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres, SQLite and MySQL."}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/imd/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 31, 2019","title":"IMD Business School","subtitles":["Experts in developing global leaders through high-impact executive education.
