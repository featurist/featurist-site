7digital provides a catalogue of over 30 million high-quality music tracks and a wealth of uniquely curated recommendations.

Samsung selected 7digital as the strategic partner for Music Hub. In 2012 with the launch of Samsung Galaxy S3 devices in Europe and North America the Music Hub has began to include subscription streaming alongside their music downloads.

Featurist worked with 7digital to develop a new API to power subscriptions on the Samsung Music Hub.
