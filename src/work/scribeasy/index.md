[Scribeasy](http://www.scribeasy.com/) is a comprehensive creative writing app for children that helps with inspiration and enables broader ideas. It contains extensive resources for schools and organisations and allows integration with custom content.

Featurist first worked with Artsmiths Ltd to develop an iPad app in [Ruby Motion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

We then developed a cross platform Node.js app using Express and our own [hyperdom](../../projects/hyperdom/).

This new version is feature rich and supports management of assets, users and content, and accommodates different types of users to cover all use cases.
