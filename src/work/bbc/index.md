Featurist has provided coaching to various teams at the BBC to lead them through adoption of Behaviour Driven Development.

Our coaches can help your team to take the first step towards BDD, or we can help more experienced teams tackle their most intractable testing problems.

We have also worked with the BBC to develop on the accessibility standards checker [bbc-a11y](https://github.com/bbc/bbc-a11y).
