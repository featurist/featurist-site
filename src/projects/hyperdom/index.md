[hyperdom](https://github.com/featurist/hyperdom) is a web framework similar to React. There is one model for the whole page, this model is stateful, object-oriented and free of framework elements.

There is a render function that renders the model into HTML every time the model changes, but only applies the differences from the last render to the DOM.
