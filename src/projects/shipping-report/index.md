[Shipping Report](https://shippingreport.com/) is a Featurist product that helps give stakeholders
better insight into software development project progress.

We have built an app that pulls data from services like GitHub to produce reports that can be customised
and sent to non-technical members of the project.

Features include:

- Send customisable automatic reports by emails
- Get an overview of your repository at a glance, so you're never out of the loop
