[Browser Monkey](https://github.com/featurist/browser-monkey) is a DOM assertion library. It helps you write framework agnostic browser tests that are reliable in the face of asynchronous behaviours like animations, AJAX and delayed rendering. It also helps you to write tests that exhibit the semantic meaning of the page, as opposed to a jumble of CSS selectors.

* Timing resistant
* Create rich DSLs for your page structure
* Works with React, Angular, jQuery, [hyperdom](../hyperdom/) and more
* Can simulate text entry and clicks
* Returns promises that resolve when the elements are found
