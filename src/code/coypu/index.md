## Coypu is

* A robust wrapper for browser automation tools on .Net, such as Selenium WebDriver that eases automating ajax-heavy websites and reduces coupling to the HTML, CSS & JS
* A more intuitive DSL for interacting with the browser in the way a human being would, inspired by the ruby framework Capybara - http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara
