Coming soon: A new course from Featurist, where you learn how to build full stack JavaScript applications using fast, comprehensive and reliable automated tests.

## Overview

A one-day intensive course covering the thinking and techniques you need to test-drive the development of modern JavaScript applications - from the browser UX through to the server-side and database.

Fast and comprehensive tests are the cornerstone of continuous delivery, getting stuff done and keeping your codebase small and beautiful. itâ€™s not always easy however, in this course we show you the tools and skills you can use to achieve this.

## Programme

1. We build a simple web application containing some deliberately nasty (shall we say, realistic?) testing scenarios, like SQL, external web services, caching and client-side routing.
2. We introduce Browser Monkey, a framework that tests your UX quickly and reliably.
3. We integration test the entire application, front and back, with electron-mocha.
4. We see how we can test SQL queries by setting up a database with Sworm
5. We introduce the concept of test adapters to test both cached and non-cached scenarios.
6. We show how easy it is to mock web services with Node.js

## Audience

You will need to have at least a basic understanding of JavaScript or be experienced in another programming language.

## Bring your own hardware

To participate in building a full stack test you will need a laptop with a recent version of Node.js and your favourite editor.
